# Machine Learning Hyperparameter Optimization App (Regression Edition)

This Streamlit application allows users to perform hyperparameter tuning for a regression model using the **Random Forest** algorithm. The app provides an interactive interface to upload datasets, set hyperparameters, and visualize the model's performance.

---

## Features

- Upload CSV datasets for analysis.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Use **Random Forest Regressor** to build a regression model.
- Perform **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualize the results of hyperparameter tuning in 3D using Plotly.
- Download performance metrics and grid search results as CSV files.

## How to Use

### 1. Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Running the Application
Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 3. App Interface
- **Upload Data**: Use the sidebar to upload your CSV file or load the example **Diabetes** dataset.
- **Set Parameters**: Adjust hyperparameters for Random Forest, such as:
  - Number of estimators (`n_estimators`)
  - Maximum features (`max_features`)
  - Minimum samples for splitting/leaves (`min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`)
  - General options like random state, bootstrap, and performance metrics.
- **Model Building**: The app splits data, tunes hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**, and evaluates the model.
- **Visualize Results**: View a 3D surface plot of hyperparameter tuning results.
- **Download Results**: Download the grid search results and model performance metrics.

## Dependencies

The app requires the following Python packages:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
